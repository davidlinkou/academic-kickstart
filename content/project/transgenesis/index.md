The story revolved around taurine, an essential substance not synthesized in some animals such as felines. I was curious about taurine overproduction outcomes, so I introduced a transgene that drives ubiquitous expression of a rate-limiting enzyme in taurine synthesis, *csad*, to zebrafish using a transposon-based platform. In the end, I established two transgenic lines, quantified the csad mRNA and taurine level, and identified the precise gene insertion sites on the zebrafish genome. Interestingly, the plethora did not sway visual appearances, survival rates, or sex ratios, but stabilized the blood glucose level. These transgenic lines also contributed to another project focusing on osmoregulation on brain development. They demonstrated that endogenous taurine abundance resists knockdown of organic osmolyte trafficking protein expressions, providing me with a chance to draft a manuscript and add a stroke to science.
